The land Ozul is one shrouded with mystery. Much is to be known of its history and the land itself. Common folk go about their days never asking themselves questions about the land they inhabit. And why would they, when they get to live under the prosperous rule of [[Oskos]].

However, secrets of an ancient world is difficult to keep at bay. The truths of the land yearn to be free, and it only hopes that the inhabitants are ready for the enlightenment.
