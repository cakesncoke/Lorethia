The five houses of old are the founding families of [[Oskos]]. While many other families and parties were involved with the establishment of the capital; most of the work turning the old civilization into the thriving nation it is today was taken on by these 5 families. 4 out of the 5 houses come from pure fey blood, with **House Blackstar** being the only one from a human background. Though over the centuries the pure blood of some houses have tainted and mixed.

Each house has been given an important area around Oskos to lead as their own. These places serve to provide [[Oskos]] with enough to carry on its development unimpeded.

## House Blackstar
House Blackstar was the odd one out of the 5 houses; having their origins come from the lesser human race instead of elven ancestry. However Blackstar was the first house to receive rule over their own community.

House Blackstar is in charge of running [[Osyn]] the mining town. The Blackstar family, though one of the most powerful in all of Ozul, has continued to maintain a humble living. They are well known for employing and taking in lesser beings. They also interact the least with [[Oskos]] apart from maintaining the supply of precious ores, gems, and cave resources.

The Blackstar family is also the most expanded out of all the Houses; even though only 3 generations are currently still living.
