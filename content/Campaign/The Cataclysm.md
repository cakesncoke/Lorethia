The cataclysm is the defining turning point of Ozul as a land. It is described in [[The Kings Enchiridion]] as a *cleansing of old sin*. The cataclysm is often misunderstood as a singular even; in truth, the cataclysm was a series of world altering events that spanned an entire year.

## Before The Cataclysm
The world before the cataclysm was vastly different to the present time. Before its events, the world had no gods. [[Spirits & Shadows]] ran rampant, with nothing restraining their abilities to interact with the material plane.

Most species that roamed [[Ozul]] at this time were wild untamed beasts. Evidence found suggests that the first intelligent beings to rise during this timeframe were the **fey**. Together with their then inferior brethren the **humans**, they began to construct a civilization. It is estimated that the rise of the first civilization started around 5000 BC.

Magic during this period of time was unconstrained; with wild magic wreaking havoc throughout the land. It is theorized that this wild magic may have been the cause for the cataclysm events. However records of magic being used around the first civilization began appearing around 300 BC.

Whilst evidence of magic was beginning to become more common place, the first recorded instance of true magic wielding come from the 200 BC. Where a written account of 3 brothers were found with detailed descriptions of rudimentary rituals and spells. These 3 figures become a significant part of Ozul history and hence are referred to as [[The Trinity]]. 
## The Year of The Cataclysm
After the initial chaos and confusion of the first few events of the cataclysm; efforts started being made towards a solution. There has been no complete record of all the cataclysm events ever recorded, however separate records recovered paint a picture of a mystic disease spreading through the land.

Many modern theories have been proposed as to the source of the destructions that occurred, with the most commonly accepted one being the spread of [[Human Sin]]. This theory also encompasses the birth and spread of many lesser beings.

Various evidence have been recovered from this time confirming the involvement of [[The Trinity]] in the efforts of stopping the cataclysm. Many significant ritual sites have been uncovered, namely in [[The Ruins of Rho]]. Studies are being conducted to this day, nearly 4 millennia since the cataclysm, about the original ritual which saved [[Ozul]]. Though the mechanics of the ritual still cannot be replicated, it has been suggested that the use of spirit energy was a major component.

## Post Cataclysm
The first few years after the cataclysm was occupied with rebuilding the old civilization. However, very clear documentations about the fate of [[The Trinity]] was maintained.

During the first 2 centuries post cataclysm, the spirits roaming the land of [[Ozul]] gave their blessings to the 3 mages of old. This involved the [[Spirits & Shadows]] giving up their material forms to the heroes. While at the time this transaction was mutual between both spirits and shadows equally, overtime the shadows began developing a bitter regret for giving up their material forms. The blessings the 3 mages received allowed them to transcend the planes of mortals and ascend to a higher form, after which they ceased all interactions with the mortal plane.

[[Oskos]] was built up from the surviving remains of a settlement from the old civilization. This monumental achievement occurred only 2 centuries after the cataclysm and was achieved through a collaboration between humans and elves. During this time a more meticulous system of written historical records also began to be implemented, making the rest of history a less vague mystery. It was also during this time that [[The Church of Trinity]] formed and worship of [[The Trinity]] became more commonplace.

Many towns supporting [[Oskos]] also began forming in rapid succession to the initiation of the capital, and [[The Five Houses of Old]] each began taking lead in these towns. Formation of [[The Council]] also took place within this golden age, and with it the first plans of building a dedicated college for magic materialized. Soon afterwards the [[Tower of Valor]] and the [[Tower of Scholar]] were built on the edge of Oskos. With this, magic began to be more common place in normal everday society, and the talent was able to be wielded by even the lesser creatures of the Land.
