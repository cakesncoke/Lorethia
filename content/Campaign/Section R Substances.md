Certain harmful substances are deemed unsafe for public use and are made illegal to use, own, or trade within [[Oskos]] and its territories. These substances are specified under section R of [[The Oskos Law Book]]; and hence are commonly referred to as section R substances or SRs.
## Common SRs
### Spirit Dust
Spirit dust is a premium SR, going for around 10gp per gram. It is a pale yellow dust that is inhaled. Effects of this SR include increased strength and awareness as well as faster judgment skills. Due to its high price tag, spirit dust is rarely seen anywhere but an aristocrats mansion.

### Knolls Leaf
Knolls leaf is a green leafy plant grown in magically tampered soils. It is ground up and burned to give of a vapor that can cause extreme relaxation; even to the point of harm. Knolls leaf can be easily grown in tampered soils and hence is popular in less urban areas where more land is available to grow it. It can go from anywhere between 60sp to 2gp per 10 gram.

### Dragon Piss
Dragon Piss is made through fermentation of serpent blood. This tedious process is often made much easier through the use of magic and alchemy; making refined dragon piss to hold a decent price tag. The only way to take in dragon piss is through a serpent tooth. The user must dip the tooth into the liquid and puncture themselves with it. The effects are much stronger than Knolls Leaf; however the after effects tend to be just as tough. Dragon piss can usually be bought for around 30sp per ounce though refined dragon piss is sold for nearly 8gp per ounce.

### Drow Meat
Despite the name, drow meat is a type of fungus that grown on infused pine trees (pine trees grown on corpses of magic users). It is the most rare SR and is typically frowned upon even by other SR users. Drow meat produces high intensity hallucinations when ingested some which can last upto days.
