**Oskos** is the central hub of [[Ozul]], the ruling Kingdom of the land under which the majority of the settlements serve. It was part of a larger settlement from before [[The Cataclysm]], the only segment that survived the horrors.

**Oskos is made up of 4 distinct regions and 4 towers at each corner of the city:**

## The Councils Court
The councils court is at the center of Oskos. Made up of towering manors housing [[The Council]] line. This includes the current ruling council of 10 as well as any previous figures that held the position and any apprentices next in line for a seat.

Access to the councils court is limited to the above mentioned parties as well as [[The Council Guard]], the council courier and the heads of [[House Bronzeward]]. The council guard take shifts in patrolling
the area and keeping anyone without access out of the area. They do not interact or meddle in the business and workings of the council.

In-council meetings occur at the residence of the ruling council head (who remains unknown to the public). Meetings with other parties take place outside court and is often attended by the council courier in the councils stead.

## The Established Residential Area
Immediately surrounding the councils court is the established residential area. As the name suggests this area mainly contains residential units and houses a population of nearly 2000.

The area is also facilitated with much higher living standards than other regions within or even outside Oskos. This is in part due to this area being established during the birth of the Oskos rule; leading many of the founding families to take up residency.

A majority of the current population in the area is filled with elven traders and with the humans who sold their claim of land to these traders; both parties coming out of these agreements wealthier and able to afford the luxuries of the established residential area.

While most building in the area serve as privately own homes of various individuals, some have been fancied into inns providing the highest end services in all of [[Ozul]]. Other services are provided by individuals inside their private houses. Certain houses are famous for serving mouth-watering meals while others are appreciated for the plays that they host. This system works in tandem with the social circles that form in the area. 

There are also a few merchants who conduct businesses straight out of their homes. However these merchants have exclusive circles and few are able to trade with them. These merchants also often hold biddings for many rare artifacts, some even choosing to sell away rare family heirlooms in their thirst for amassing wealth. This also by far the safest way of obtaining [Spirit Dust](Section%20R%20Substances.md).

The area is also patrolled heavily by [[The City Guard]], protecting it from gathering unwanted parties. Surveillance by the guard on residence of the area, however, is laughable minimal.

## The Workers Residence
The workers residence is made up of a large number of craft houses, warehouses, community hubs and servant houses. It is also by far the most diverse in terms of species living in the area.

Many skilled craftsmen of lesser origins practice and produce their crafts in the workers residence. Many of them provide tutelage for wandering traders and others who seek them. There are also dedicated school houses which teach those unfortunate enough to be unable to afford a private tutor.

The workers residence also have massive warehouses sprawled between houses. These are often owned by elven traders living further up in the established residential area. However some are used by residential artisans to store raw materials and or finished products. Most warehouses are made identical to deter thieves as they won't be able to distinguish the more valuable lots. Warehouses are also often guarded by paid City Guard or in some cases by members of [[Deepwork]].

This area also has a number of small service providers such as inns, taverns, brothels, and even some establishments for higher folk such as libraries and artefactories.

[[The City Guard]] patrol the area though with a significantly smaller task force than in the established residential area. These guards are also less trained and serve more as surveillance than crime prevention.

## The Outer Markets
The bustling outer ring of the city is home to travelling merchants and local craft displays. All trade is authorized in this area apart from [[Section R Substances]] and as a result many exotic and often dangerous products can be found.

The outer markets, though not officially required, works in a duel shift system. Traders that are open in the day retreat for the night, leaving room for a new set of displays once the sun sets.

Many traders setting up shop in the outer markets are either sponsored by elven traders or are part of a certain elven trading ring. This does not mean that independent vendors cannot be found, though only a very streetwise mind can come across these special traders.

Patrol in the outer markets work different to the other regions in the city. Outposts are set up around the markets each with two city guards in attendance. These guards spread apart once the sun sets and the night markets begin, leading to a wider range covered during the darker hours. Complaints need to be submitted individually to the guards, though they are told not to engage in petty theft or disputes. Such crimes are expected to be dealt by the vendors themselves.

# Towers
## [[Tower of Scholar]]
## [[Tower of Valor]]
## The City Guard Tower
The south-east tower of Oskos is given to [[House Bronzeward]]. The tower is mainly used to house and train [[The City Guard]]. The guards are also given an area surrounding the tower for their ground trainings.

## The Council Guard Tower
The council guard tower houses and trains [[The Council Guard]]. Due to the significantly smaller numbers of the council guard, a great many resources and space is allocated for training facilities. Unlike the city guards tower which uses a barracks system, the council guard tower has individual dorms for each soldier and provide a much higher standard of living as well.
