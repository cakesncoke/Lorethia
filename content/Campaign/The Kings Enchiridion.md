The kings enchiridion is the most widely accepted account of [[Ozul]] history. It also features a bestiary with notes on all intelligent beings found throughout the lands.

The enchiridion has been worked on personally by the dean of [[Tower of Scholar]] and the head of [[House Stagwoods]], as well as hundreds of other scholars. The king himself is also rumored to have contributed sections of the book, though they were never officially confirmed by any parties involved.

The kings enchiridion is easily accessible; to the point that it is a staple in even the lesser mans household. It is also taught at most major schools, and private tutors are often advised to teach young students history through the help of the enchiridion.
